          The page has been with us for a long time now. A few millennia, actually.
          The first books were thick slabs of clay created about 4,000 years ago,
          soon replaced by scrolls as the preferred way to consume the written word.
          And while reading technology has come a long way – from papyrus to parchment
          to paperback to pixels – the concept of the page holds strong to this day.
        </p>

          The page metaphor has been baked into the lexicon of the web since the
          very beginning. Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web so that he,
          his colleagues at CERN, and other academics could easily share and
          link together their world of documents. This document-based, academic
          genesis of the web is why the concept of the page is so deeply ingrained
          in the vocabulary of the internet.

          So what?
        </p>
        <p>
          As we’ll discuss throughout this book, the way things are named very
          much impacts how they’re perceived and utilized. Thinking of the web
          as pages has real ramifications on how people interact with web experiences,
          and influences how we go about creating web interfaces.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the beginning, the page metaphor provided users with a familiar
          language with which to navigate this brave new World Wide Web. Concepts
          like bookmarking and pagination helped new web users explore and
          eventually master an entirely new medium using conventions they were
          already comfortable with.

          The page was – and continues to be – a very visible and helpful metaphor
          for the users of the web. It also has a profound influence on how web
          experiences are created.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the early days of the web, companies looking to get online simply
          translated their printed materials onto their websites. But even though
          these brochure websites offered a very one-dimensional perspective of
          what the web could offer, viewing websites as digital representations
          of the printed page was easy for creators to wrap their heads around.
        </p>
        <p>
          But we’re now 25 years into this new medium, and this once necessary
          figure of speech has overstayed its welcome. Unfortunately, the page
          metaphor continues to run deep with respect to how we scope and execute
          our web projects. Here are just a few examples I hear on a regular basis:
        </p>
        <p>
          “We’re a startup looking to launch a five-page website this October…”
        </p>
        <p>
          “Brad, how long will the homepage take to build?”
        </p>
        <p>
          “How are we ever going to redesign this university website that
          contains over 30,000 pages?!”
        </p>
        <p>
          All of the statements above make the fundamental mistake of assuming
          a page is a uniform, isolated, quantifiable thing. The reality is that
          the web is a fluid, interactive, interdependent medium. As soon as we
          come to terms with this fact, the notion of the page quickly erodes as
          a useful means to scope and create web experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          How long will a homepage take to build? Well, that sort of depends on
          what’s on it, right? Maybe the homepage simply consists of a tagline
          and a background image, which means it could be done by lunch. Or maybe
          it’s chock-full of carousels, dynamic forms, and third-party integrations.
          In that case, maybe the homepage will take several months to complete.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for the 30,000-page university website, it might be tempting to
          declare, “Thousands of pages?! Wow, that sounds challenging!” But in
          reality, those 30,000 pages may consist of three content types and two
          overarching layouts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ultimately, a project’s level of effort is much better determined by
          the functionality and components contained within those pages, rather
          than on the quantity of pages themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          The page metaphor has served its purpose helping users familiarize
          themselves with the web, and provided creators with the necessary
          transitional language with which to create for a brand new medium. But
          to build thoughtful interfaces meant to be served to a multitude of
          connected devices, the time has come for us to evolve beyond the page.
