# Hierarchy

## Typescale

To make long-form content easier to read, it needs a clear visual hierarchy. Using a type scale will apply scientific rationale to your font-sizes to achieve visual harmony.

## Base font-size

- The first thing to decide is the size of the text at the base level. This will be applied to most of the text content and is usually displayed in paragraphs.
- LongForm uses `16px` for the base unit size as its easier to achieve round numbers when multiplying and dividing this figure ‚Äì¬†helping to avoid sub-pixels.

### Start with mobile

- The optimal font size for small screens is usually¬†**12‚Äì16 pixels**.
- This is considered mobile-friendly by search engines and is easier to read than smaller or larger fonts.
- LongForm uses `14px` on small screens with a font-size of `0.875em`

### Scale up for larger screens

- As screens get larger, the overall font-size should increase too.
- When sitting in front of a desktop monitor, there‚Äôs a greater distance between the screen and our eyes.
- Increasing the font-size helps to keep the content comfortable to read.
- LongForm is set to scale up 1.5 times from mobile to desktop.

## Heading sizes

- HTML has six levels of heading `h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6`
- In real-world use, most long-form content only uses 3 or 4 heading levels.
- LongForm has been optimised for 4 levels of heading, but covers all 6.

# Readability

---

## Line-height

The amount of space between each line of text affects how comfortable it is to read through chunk of content.

### Body

- For paragraphs, values between 1.3 and 1.5 are typically recommended for good readability, although this varies with font face and line length
- A11y: According to W3 Web Accessibility Initiative, you should ensure line height is at least 1.5 x the font size
- LongForm uses `1.5`

### Headings

- It's uncommon for headings to break on to two lines, so line-height is less of an issue for readability.
- A small line height is more suitable for large font sizes to keep things more compact.
- LongForm uses `1.125`

## Line-length

The optimal line length for readability is¬†**between 45 and 75 characters per line**.¬†Lines that are too long or too short can make text difficult to read:

- Too long and it‚Äôs harder to move your eyes to the beginning of the next line
- Too short and it disrupts the flow of reading and the text feels disjointed
- LongForm sets the `max-width` to 800px / 50em, but you can adjust this to suit your project.

## Color contrast

The text and background `color` combinations used on your project have an affect on how easy it is to read your content. 

- Contrast isn't just for people with impaired vision, it's also for anyone who's using a device in mixed lighting conditions, or even when using a poor or dirty display.
- LongForm is set to inherit the color from your project.
- Please ensure your content passes AA contrast with a ration of 5 or more.

# **Meaning**

---

> With the bulk of the styles taken care of, it's time to think about text-level presentation.
> 

## Emphasis

We're all familiar with these styling staples. Use them wisely to best effect.

### Bold and Strong

### Italic and Emphasis

## Lists

Lists are a great tool to break up large chunks of text and make content easier to scan and digest, especially on a digital medium where readers quickly scroll up and down and can be gone in seconds.

LongForm includes styles for:

- Bullet list `ul`
- Numbered lists `ol`
- Description list `dl`

**Next level list**

- Custom bullets and numbers
- Alternative layouts

## Quotes

### Inline quotes

The `q` element can be used to style quotes inside paragraphs, without disrupting the text flow.

- It's common for italics to be used to style inline quotes, but the `q` element applies `‚Äú‚Äù` quote marks for you, and makes your content more semantic. You should use it!
- LongForm *italicises* inline quotes to help them stand out.

### Block quotes

To create more contrast between the main content and a `blockquote`, LongForm uses:

- the same font-family as headings `$lf-headings-font-family`
- a larger font-size `1.5em`
- Inset spacing and a vertical border

## Semantics

If you want to go the extra mile, then applying text-level semantics to your content will give it maximum meaning.

### Abbreviations and Definitions

If you're covering a niche or complicated topic, then your project is likely going to be using some terms or acronyms that need a short explanation.

In the HTML for your content you can wrap words in `abbr` or `dfn` to recognise it as keyword.

You can then add a `title` attribute to include a description.

EXAMPLE 

- LongForm adds a subtle border to elements with a title. When users hover

### Subscript and Superscript

Whether it's chemicals H20 or  temperatures 150¬∞F, it looks so much better when those characters are tucked away at the top or bottom.

### Cite and Address

If you quote someone else in your content, make sure you credit the author. 

Put the author name in a `cite` and if you have a link their website or online profile, that should be wrapped in `address`

- LongForm includes subtle styles for these, but you can make them your own.

### Time

If you include a date or time in your content it should be contained in a `time` element.

- LongForm applies a style that's influenced by a traditional calendar, using a red border to highlight the information.
- You can adapt this to suit your project or remove the styles to return `time` to the same appearance as default text.

## Technical formatting

If your content covers science, mathematics or technology, then there‚Äôs a good chance you‚Äôll need to use these semantic elements.

- Code
- Var
- Kbd
- Samp
- Pre

LongForm uses:

- a mono space font family
- a background color
- a border radius

## Editing

If your content has a long shelf life and changes over time, you may want to display which words have been updated.

LongForm uses subtle color-coding to highlight these elements and give them more meaning.

- Marked `mark` - highlight some text
- Inserted `ins` - show added/valid text
- Deleted `del` - show removed/invalid

## Tabular data

LongForm includes some styles to handle basic tabular data. 

Example table

üóëÔ∏è

You can remove these styles if your project doesn't involve tables.

## Graphics

Written content is always best served with some photos, illustrations or dataviz. Afterall, *a picture paints a thousand words.*

Images

SVGs

Canvas

## Other media

Occasionally LongForm incorporates other types of media such as `audio` or `video`. 

Sometimes, entire web pages need to be embedded within an `iframe`.

LongForm includes styles for the default media players used by browsers.

# Personality

---

> This is where it gets personal and subjective. Luckily, your site will already have an existing brand with selected typefaces and specific ways to use them.
> 

## Typefaces and font families

- LongForm assigns a font-family to the base and headings
- If your content involves `code` then you‚Äôll also need to define your preferred mono-space font-family.

If you‚Äôre working on a new project or a redesign then you have the fun job of choosing which fonts you want to use.

Otherwise, you can update the variables in LongForm to match your the existing fonts used in your project.

- `$lf-base-font-family`
- `$lf-heading-font-family`
- `$lf-code-font-family`
